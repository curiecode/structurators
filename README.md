# Structurators

> A shitty portmanteau of `structure` and `iterators`, i.e., a collection of tools for treating various non-immediately iterable structures as iterable.

Currently has some tools for iterating across, in various fashions: 

- Cartesian Grids
    ✔️ Iterate across cells
    ✔️ Iterate across neighbors
    ✔️ Iterate by vector
    ❌ Features coming shortly like bounding boxes
    ❌ Soon will support layered, quad/octtree like iterators
- Treelike Structures
    ✔️ "n-ary" tree leaf iterator
    ❌ Might support some complex linked list style trees in the future
    ❌ Might support some graphlike structures in the future

Examples & docs coming soon
